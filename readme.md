# Command Modern Operations (CMO) Scenario Testing Repository


NOTE: This repository is currently invite only while in design phase. The idea is to open up once we reach a solid baseline

## Overview

This repository serves as a centralized hub for **Command Modern Operations (CMO)** scenario development, testing, and documentation. It contains:

- **Lua Scripts**: Custom scripting for scenario behaviors, events, AI enhancements, and mission logic.
- **Gameplay Documents**: Guides, walkthroughs, and design notes for scenario mechanics, objectives, and player strategies.
- **Testing Assets**: Save files, unit databases, weather/mission parameter templates, and automated test scripts to validate functional and technical aspects of scenarios.

The focus is on **functional testing** (e.g., does the scenario play as intended?) and **technical testing** (e.g., Lua errors, compatibility with CMO versions, performance benchmarks).

Whether you're a scenario designer, tester, or CMO enthusiast, this repo provides tools and resources to build, refine, and share high-quality scenarios.
