This is where users should create new scenario directories. Each scenario should have the following:
1. A readme.md file that details the contents, implementation steps and pointers to all help files related with scenario. If scenario files are hosted on Steam workshop, include link here
2. A gameplay documents folder containing PDF, .txt, .ppt or .doc file(s) for each human playable side and designer guide for computer only side. Try to validate OpenOffice compatible file formats before releasing
3. A lua code folder and subfolders for scenarios where lua code was used. All code should adhere to the /templates/examplecode.lua styleguide
